# BestBooks

Welcome to Best Books! This Ruby gem provides the user with a list of the Top 200 books published this year that people have added on the website Goodreads. You can browse book titles and see more info including author, rating and the book url. Information is pulled from "https://www.goodreads.com/book/popular_by_date/2019".

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_books'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_books

## Usage

Running ./bin/best_books will start the program. A menu is provided after the list of books.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
